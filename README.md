# wiki-simulation
## Description:
The project (developed during CS50â€™s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript course) is a simulation of [Wikipedia](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikip%C3%A9dia:P%C3%A1gina_principal) website.
## Operation:
The users are able to access, edit and delete existing pages and also create new ones!
## Used techs:
- Python, HTML and CSS
- Django and Bootstrap
## Limitations:
- It isn't responsive, as the main purpose of the project is to improve Django skills (such as data manipulation).
- It doesn't have a registration system, so anyone can edit and delete the existing pages.
